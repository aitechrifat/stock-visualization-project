# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

## Description
This project demonstrates the process of extracting essential stock data from web sources and visualizing it. This is a crucial part of data science, enabling users to make informed decisions based on the displayed data. The notebook extracts stock data and then displays this data in a graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries (install via `pip` if you don't have them):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```
    *(Note: The actual required libraries might vary slightly based on the specific content of your notebook. This list is a common set for stock data analysis.)*

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [[https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/aitechrifat/stock-visualization-project.git))
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd stock-visualization-project
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries** (if not already installed, as listed in Prerequisites).

## Usage
1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open `Final Assignment (1).ipynb`** in your web browser, which will launch automatically.
3.  **Run all cells** within the notebook to execute the data extraction, processing, and visualization steps.

## File Structure
* `Final Assignment (1).ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Numpy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)
* Seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)
* Jupyter Notebook (for interactive computing)
* yfinance (likely used for fetching stock data)
* BeautifulSoup4 (likely used for web scraping, if applicable)
